# macTilt

The **macTilt** 3D clamshell fold animation for MacBooks, driven by the physical lid angle sensor.

> *"When the lid closes, the picture on its screen stays where it is in space while the hardware sweeps through it: the image frosts over and slips into black without ever changing its size."*

Rather than rendering inside a separate window, **the entire macOS display follows the animation in 3D space as you close your MacBook lid**.

## NOTE

- **Opening MacBook**: Works on lockscreen via private skyline APIs
- **Normal MacBook Use**: when you are actively using your MacBook (lid open), the app does **nothing** — the overlay is completely hidden, with zero CPU/GPU overhead and full click-through.
- **Closing MacBook**: as you tilt the screen closed, the display freezes the screen and seamlessly folds **from up to down** toward the bottom keyboard hinge into the dark void.
- **Clamshell desktop mode**: with an external display attached and the built-in panel asleep, the effect is suppressed — there is no visible hinge motion to animate.
- **Before permission is granted**: with the live-capture source selected, the effect stays entirely off until Screen Recording is allowed. Nothing is drawn over the desktop and the app is inert, so a lid that is already partly shut at launch cannot leave a frozen-looking image on screen.
- **No Input Monitoring**: macTilt reads a single feature report from Apple's lid angle sensor. It never listens for keyboard or pointer input, so it does not need Input Monitoring — and on a Mac without the sensor it never opens a HID device at all. To stop the probe entirely, run `defaults write com.lqsky7.mactilt mactilt_probeLidAngleSensor -bool NO` and relaunch; macTilt then runs on the clamshell switch only.

## Hardware Support

macTilt adapts to the lid hardware it finds:

- **Macs with Apple's continuous lid angle sensor** (Vendor `0x05AC`, Product `0x8104`, UsagePage `0x0020`, Usage `0x008A`): the fold is driven 1:1 by the live hinge angle, at up to 120 Hz.
- **Macs with only the binary clamshell switch** (for example the MacBook Pro 13" M1): there is no continuous angle to read, so macTilt plays a smooth time-based unfold whenever the lid opens, with an adjustable duration.

Which of the two a machine is gets decided from the IORegistry, before any HID access, so a Mac with no sensor never opens a HID device — and the probe itself only ever opens the sensor, never the accelerometer, gyroscope or ambient light sensor that share its product ID.

## Features
- just install and see duh

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later.
- A MacBook with a lid. The hardware paths need a hinge to read; on a desktop Mac only the interactive preview is available.
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`swiftc`, `xcrun metal`).

## Installing

Download `macTilt.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/lqSky7/iphone-duo-macos-animation/releases/latest), open it, and drag **macTilt** into **Applications**.

### macOS will block it twice — this is expected

macTilt is **signed but not notarized**. There is no paid Apple Developer ID behind it, so Gatekeeper cannot verify the app against Apple and refuses it by default. You will hit **two separate blocks**, and you have to clear **both** — clearing the first one does not clear the second.

**1. When opening the DMG**

> *"macTilt.dmg" cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.*

- **Right-click** (or Control-click) the `.dmg` in Finder and choose **Open**, then confirm **Open** again in the dialog.
- If there is no **Open** entry: go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down to the **Security** section, and click **Open Anyway** next to the message about `macTilt.dmg`. Then try opening the DMG again.

**2. When launching the app**

> *"macTilt" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.*

- **Right-click** `macTilt.app` in **Applications** and choose **Open**, then confirm **Open** again.
- If there is no **Open** entry: **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** next to the message about `macTilt.app`, then launch it again.

Both dialogs use roughly the wording above, but Apple changes the exact copy between macOS releases — the route is always the same: right-click **Open**, or **Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**. You only have to do this once per download; after that macOS remembers and the app opens normally.

**Terminal alternative.** If you would rather skip the dialogs, remove the download's quarantine flag instead:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/macTilt.app
```

That only clears the flag on your own machine — it does not make the download any more trustworthy to anyone else, so only use it when you trust the source.

### Screen Recording permission

macTilt needs Screen Recording in order to freeze your desktop into the fold. **The animation stays completely off until that permission is granted** — the app draws nothing over your screen, and it never starts a half-rendered or substitute fold in the meantime. Grant it from the onboarding window on first launch, or later from **Settings → Screen Recording Permission**.

## Building from Source

Run the automated build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Every run of `./build.sh`:

1. Increments the patch version and the build number in `Info.plist`.
2. Compiles the Metal shaders into `default.metallib`.
3. Compiles the Swift application as a universal binary (arm64 + x86_64, targeting macOS 14.0+).
4. Codesigns the app bundle.
5. Creates `build/macTilt.dmg`.
6. Installs directly to `/Applications/macTilt.app`.

---

## Launching

Open the installed application from `/Applications`, or run:

```bash
open /Applications/macTilt.app
```

The menu bar icon shows your current lid status. **Settings** lets you customize the tilt thresholds and preview the animation live.
